OPS-201d8 Code Challenges

Hello everyone! This is my first ever repository in my coding journey, a collection of the code challenges I completed in OPS 201 at Code Fellows.

Why am I learning these skills?
I am diving into these skills as part of my career transition into Cybersecurity.

Fundamental Concepts
Through the course OPS 201, I gained a basic understanding of Bash and PowerShell, including comprehending the syntax differences between these two languages.

Favorite Assignment
Among all the Ops Challenge assignments, the ones that used Bash were my favorites. PowerShell posed a more significant challenge, but it was a rewarding learning experience.

Real-World Application
Scripting can be an extremely powerful tool in the workplace. Using scripts to automate the setup of new systems can greatly speed up the process, making you appear competent and efficient.

Continuous Improvement
Given the time, I plan to further improve my knowledge and skills in the "main" scripting languages: Bash, PowerShell, and Python.

Future Aspirations
In my quest to "work smarter, not harder", I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the various applications of scripts. Here's to the exciting journey ahead in shell scripting!
